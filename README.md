# 🐳 Multi-Staged Docker Optimization

This project demonstrates how to build optimized Docker images using **multi-stage builds** for various web frameworks and technologies, including **GoLang**, **Django**, **Laravel**, and **ReactJS**. By using multi-stage Dockerfiles, we significantly reduce the final image size, eliminate unnecessary build tools from production containers, and improve build caching and performance.

## 📦 Technologies Covered

| Stack      | Optimization Goal                                  |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| GoLang     | Compile binary statically and copy only executable |
| Django     | Separate build and runtime stages using Gunicorn   |
| Laravel    | Use composer & npm only in build stage             |
| ReactJS    | Serve static files via Nginx in final stage        |

## 📌 Benefits of Multi-Stage Builds

- Smaller Image Size: No compilers or build tools in final image
- More Secure: Fewer packages, less attack surface
- Faster Deployment: Lightweight containers, better caching
- Cleaner Structure: Build-time and runtime clearly separated

## 🧠 Conclusion

This project showcases best practices for building production-ready containers using Docker’s multi-stage builds. Whether you’re working with Go, Python, PHP, or JavaScript—optimizing your Dockerfiles can lead to faster builds, smaller images, and better security.
